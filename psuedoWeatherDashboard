------- Functionality -------

Target html elements for each container layed out in the HTML skeleton.

The use JS to display the text of the containers.

We will have to get the city they want to display. We can use the users location or it will use the city that they searched for instead.

The we will call the https://openweathermap.org/api to get the weather information using the user home location or searched location.

We will then parse the data that is retrieved to be able to acces the data keys/value pairs.

We will then target the values that we need using the keys of the object we received.

Once we have all the values we need - Target the innerHTML to display it in the order via the HTML skeleton.
